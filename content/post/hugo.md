In an attempt to improve my online presence, I have found [Hugo](http://gohugo.io), a "Fast & Modern Static Website Engine".  Since I've been doing a bit of playing/learning [Go](https://golang.org) lately finding a static site generator written in [Go](https://golang.org) is really nice.  So far it seems to work pretty well.  If you are able to read this post then apparently I also figured out how to have it deploy to Amazon's S3 automatically. 

I did find one quirk that I am unsure about.  [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) has automatic [Summaries](https://gohugo.io/content/summaries/) which are the first 70 words of a post with HTML stripped.  The particular [theme that I am using](https://github.com/cxfksword/greyshade) uses the summaries in the main site index as well.  I may end up having to change that, but for now I'm going to run with it and see how I feel.
